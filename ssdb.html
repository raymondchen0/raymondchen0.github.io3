                <p class="left">SSDb (Solid State Drive Database) is an endeavor to create a central hub to easily keep track of solid state drive prices and general techology news.SSDb arranges and sorts the SSDs into key categories that are easy to read and decipher. There were elements of data gathering and many revisions to get it right</p>
                <p class="right">The most challenging part of this arose when I had to figure out a system that was easy to be read at a glance that also provided all the needed information. I had to make icons that would show how fast a drive was, the storage capacity, what the form factor was and one of the most important aspects, the price per GB of the Solid State Drive.</p>

                            <p>SSdb focuses on easy to read information. Its main goal is to inform buyers on whhich drive is cheapest or the best value in terms of price to performance. Of course, the form factor is another improtant consideration. To deem the project successful I had to create iconography that was easy to read at small sizes which also packed in a large amount of information.</p>
