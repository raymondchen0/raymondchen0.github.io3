                <p class="left">There was a need to redesign the old and unsightly sponsorship forms. There was no hierarchy within the typography which made distringuishing the seperate areas of the form difficult. One major issue was there was a lot of necessary information that I could not cut from the form. These were important things such as contact information and information for billing.</p>
                <p class="right">After initial discussions and brainstorming I decided to heavily incorporate the current design standards of Allenspond and Mass Audubon into the design of the form. I wanted it to look professional but not boring. Below are 3 iterations based off initial discussions with the client.</p>

                            <p>The forms evolved into two seperate things. There was the main for that would most likely stay in an office setting for people that wanted to doante. However, there became a more fun card sized form. The form on the front states the mission of of Mass Audubon and uses the birds that represent Allens Pond. The use of imagery was a key aspect that the client wanted. The imagery will aid in drawing in the attention of viewers at events. Furthermore the back of the form allows for both the physical completion of the form or a convenient QR code to scan for the online version.</p>
