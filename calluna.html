                </div>
                <p class="left">The initial thought process for this project came to be for my Identity and Branding class. I knew that to maintain interest and to create a great piece of work I needed to decide on a topic that interested me. I had an old project that was titled "Seizure Monitor", however that project never got to a stage that seemed polished and complete. I decided to build upon it and it eolved into a brand that strived to create a segment of medical technology that would improve the lives of epilispy sufferers.</p>
                <p class="right">I wanted to brand to distinguish itself from similar products by being inconspicuous and by having more useful features. The focus then, was to create a brand that sold smart wearables that would use an assortment of sensors to give warning and detect upcoming seizures. Calluna would also include useful medical features such as reminders to take medicine or keep seizure information stored where doctors would be able to later analyze what happened before, during, and after the seizure.</p>

                            <h1>Conclusion</h1>
                            <p>Overall Calluna elolved from the rough sketches of Cs to being inspired by the Calluna plant. The plant more commonly known as heather became the inspiration for the overaching design on the identity and branding. The Epilepsy Foundation uses reeds and purples that mimic the heather plant. Furthermore, some people regard the plant has having positive benefits for the treatment of epilepsy. Calluna became an easy to distringuish identity that is able to be applied towards various applications based on size requirements. The flower mark can be used on its own for things such as smartwatches and the entire logomark can be used in places where there is space.</p>
