                </div>
                <p class="left">After researching Lipton and investigating their target audience I noticed that there was a discrepancy when it their marketing. Lipton's website contained a lot of imagery that implied young people would be out drinking their tea and other products. It was interesting that the imagery was so similar to a late night bar seen.</p>
                <p class="right">I decided to take an approach towards shifting the target audience towards an older demographic. It would target those that were ages 45+. This demographic is associated with more frequent tea drinking. They would also have more disposable income. Due to this I also decide to turn Lipton into an upscale brand in order to capitalize on the available wealth.</p>

                            <p>I ended up going towards a Asian feel with the packaging. I also decided to use metal to give it a premium feel. The imagery and textures give it a sophisticated feel. The log has also been simplified and their slogan is now prominently displayed as a tagline underneath.</p>
